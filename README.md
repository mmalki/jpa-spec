# jpa-spec

> The jpa-spec repository was created in order to provide sample data to be
> used with a DZone article designed to communicate the benefits of Spring Data, 
> JPA and Specifications.

## Using This Repository

The repository is a Spring Boot application, which can be executed by running the `JpaSpecApplication` files in the `com.gitlab.johnjvester.jpaspec` package.  

When the application starts, an in-memory H2 database will be created and initialized with some default data.  The inserts for this data can be found in the `src\main\resources\data.sql` file.

## RESTful EndPoints

Once the application is running, simply launch the following URL to see unfiltered data:

`http://localhost:9000/members`

If you wish to see only active members, launch the following URL:

`http://localhost:9000/members?active=true` (false will return inactive members)

If you wish to search for a partial zip code, use the following URL:

`http://localhost:9000/members?zipFilter=902` (to locate zip codes which start with 902)

If you wish to search for a string, use the following URL:

`http://localhost:9000/members?searchString=tennis` (will find the string 'tennis' in the interest field or the name of a class)

Finally, these filters can be combined, as shown below:

`http://localhost:9000/members?active=true&zipFilter=902&searchString=tennis` (active members, in 902 zip code with a search of 'tennis')

## Running Specification Tests

The `JpaSpecificationApplicationTests` class includes four tests that are executed against a dataset which is populated 
within the `init()` method of the same class.  The tests are intended to validate and provide code coverage for the 
`BaseSpecification` and `MemberSpecification` classes.

The tests can be executed using the following maven command:

`mvn test`

Upon successful execution, the following information will be provided:
